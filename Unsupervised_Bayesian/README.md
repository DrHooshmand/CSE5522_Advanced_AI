## Project Description:
------------------------------------
Here we build a classifier that first converts continuous features into discrete classes by a process called vector quantization, using an algorithm known as k-means clustering. The entire exercise is meant to be done programmatically. The detailed [project description](project_desc.pdf) and [report of results](proj_report.pdf) can be found attached. 


## To use this software:
------------------------------------
1. Install the libraries in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) to be able to run the scripts. This can be done by: 
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt 
    ```  

2. Use python 3.6.1 to run the script as follows: 

3. Step 2-5 are implemented in section blocks seprated with commented text in 

    ```bash
	python3 kmeans.py
    ```  

4. Modification regarding data generating code is also implemented in separate .py files with following names: 

    ```bash
	generate_data_S5.py
	generate_data_Bon1.py
	generate_data_Bon2.py
    ```  

5. All the generated files are also located in the folder : `generated_files`
6. **Note**: Make sure to copy them to the root folder when running!
